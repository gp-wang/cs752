CS 752: Advanced Computer Architecture I (Fall 2014 Section 1 of 1)
Homework 2

4. Write a program that implements Sieve of Eratosthenes and outputs one single integer at the end: the number of prime
numbers <= 100,000,000. Compile your program as a static binary. The output should be: 5761455.
5. Simulate your program using the following configurations: Default Out-of-order CPU. L1 instruction cache: 32K 8-way set
associative. L1 data cache: (32K, 64K, 128K, 256K, 8-way) set associative. L2 unified cache: 1MB 8-way set associative.
Keep the block size fixed at 64-bytes. Read the file $GEM5_HOME/configs/common/Options.py to know about the available
options. Report the IPC and the cache hierarchy miss rates for the different configurations of the L1 Data cache specified
above.
For all of the above tests, use the first 100M instructions to warmup the caches and then collect statistics for next 100M
instructions.
